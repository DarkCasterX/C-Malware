# C-Malware
This is just the available name, I'll be using both C and C++ if I feel like it

Actually, this code is notably incomplete, especially the ARP poison code. In that file, ioctl() is not working, so I'll have to do more research in ioctl, what it does, and how to properly pass parameters and handle its return value.

The tcp-listen and tcp-connect are clearly just C++ clones of my python-virus code. If you read my python-virus, the functionality in this code is self-explanatory (unless you don't know C/++). In short, tcp-listen listens for a connection, then once a connection is accepted, sends fork bomb code through the socket. The tcp-connect function simply connects back to the listening machine and downloads all the data from the connection, opens a file stream, and stores all the data in that file. Actually, a functionality I added in this connection code is that I changes the process's PATH to the local directory. I did this in case I ever wanted the connection to execute the file, but that's until I figure out all the kinks. Also, I was careful with the logging on the connection file, so that like real malware, nothing would print to the screen while the file is executing.

The arppoison code I coded in C specfically to be able to assign hex bytes in a char array declaration. You can't do this in C++, and I think it looks easier. It simply sends an ARP reply to the router (crafted to convince the router that you're the victim and route its traffic to you) and another to the victim (crafted to convince the victim that you're the router). Unfortunately, my issues with ioctl() at the moment are halting me from looking out for any other mistakes in my code, but that's the general gist.

I hope someone is gracious enough to find this and set me straight on my code, I'm trying to self-teach all this stuff but it's different when you have feedback from collaborators spelling out what you're doing wrong.

Just wanted to add this at the end, as I progress with this, I'd like to learn more advanced things in this alley, like obfuscation, circumventing antivirus detection, anti-forensics, self-replicating code, and other advanced techniques that are commonly used in modern malware dev. I understand that malware isn't just downloading some code and making your computer explode, but everyone has to start somewhere.
